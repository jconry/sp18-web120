<h2>Responsive Website vs Mobile App</h2>
 <p>As more and more people continue to use mobile devices to access online content the decision regarding how to make that content available to users becomes increasingly important. Should you develop a responsive website or a native mobile app? Many factors come into play, such as, what type of business you have, who your audience is, cost, time, features and what you want your users experience to be. </p>
 <p>Responsive design allows for the creation of one website that contains specifications so it is functional, easy to use and well designed for all types of mobile devices as well as desktop and laptop computers. There are several pros and cons to creating a responsive website.   </p>      
<p>The Pros:</p>
       <ul>
           <li>Time: Making adjustments to an existing website so that it’s responsive is significantly less time consuming than creating a completely new mobile app.</li>
           <li>Cost: Rather than designing a new app adjusting the size constraints on an existing website is a more cost effective way to go.</li>
           <li>Accessibility: Since anyone can access a website via their browser it can reach a wider audience since users do not have to download an app first.</li>
           
        </ul> 
   <p>The Cons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Speed: Responsive websites are usually slower to load than mobile apps.</li>
            <li>Function: It takes users longer to navigate a website than it does an app. </li>
        </ul>
 <p>Native mobile apps have the same branding as a companies website, but they create a completely different user experience. They are increasingly valuable in todays fast paced online culture. As with responsive design there are pros and cons to creating a native mobile app. </p>
 <p>The Pros:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Speed: Mobile apps are usually quicker to load than a website and they are easy to access on your phone or tablets screen.</li>
            <li>User Experience: An app can be designed to highlight the features of your business that your users go to most so it is quick and easy for them to access. Since apps are designed for different platforms they are more intuitive depending on what type of platform you use.</li>  
            <li>Features: Mobile apps can include features such as push notifications to remind users about your company and its offerings. It keeps you fresh in their mind which is a branding and advertising bonus.</li>
        </ul>
<p>The Cons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Price: Since mobile apps development is completely separate from the development of your website there is a higher cost involved.</li>
            <li>Time: An app has to be built from scratch so it will take a lot longer to be online versus a responsive website.</li> 
        </ul>
<p>Choosing to go with a responsive website over a mobile app, or vice versa, ultimately depends on the type of business, the needs of the business and the budget and time available for the project. Not all businesses will benefit from having a mobile app, but all do need to have a responsive website. When it comes down to it the decision seems to be if a mobile app should be developed in addition to a responsive website.</p>
