    <h2>Shopping Carts</h2>
        <p>When creating an e-commerce website adding a shopping cart feature is essential. Shopping cart software allows customers to purchase the products advertised on websites, which is the main reason e-commerce sites exist. The software facilitates items being added to the online cart, paid for and shipped to the customer. There are many different options when choosing which online shopping cart to go with. The first decision is will you build your own online shopping cart or use one of the many ready to use platforms. The final decision depends on how much time you have, what your budget is and how solid your development skills are. The largest pro for building your own cart vs using a pre-existing platform is that if you choose to change providers you will most likely have to rebuild your online store.
